# Learn_TensorFlow

This is a demo object classification project for TensorFlow beginners.

The sample program in this document builds and tests a model that classifies Iris flowers into three different species based on the size of their sepals and petals.

The Iris data set contains four attributes including sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. These attributes are represented as float32 then this program will label them with Iris setosa (0),  Iris versicolor (1) Iris virginica (2), totally three classifications.
